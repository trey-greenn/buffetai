Executive Summary: AI-Generated Infographic Feature with Layout Control

This feature introduces an AI-powered infographic generator into our Next.js application. Users can describe a topic and select a preferred layout style (timeline, bar chart, comparison grid, etc.), and the system generates a high-quality infographic using OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 Image API.

Unlike typical AI image generation tools, this implementation gives users a degree of structural control through a “Layout Selector.” This ensures that visual outputs are not just creative, but also purposeful and data-aligned.

Key Benefits:
- Layout customization makes infographic generation more relevant and data-accurate.
- Non-designers can now produce content with clarity and visual structure.
- Infographics become shareable, branded assets for reports, dashboards, or social media.
- Encourages engagement by simplifying how data and concepts are visualized.

The feature combines the power of generative AI with practical UX controls, moving us closer to AI-enhanced no-code content creation.
