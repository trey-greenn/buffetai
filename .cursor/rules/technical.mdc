Technical Write-Up: AI Infographic Generator with Layout Control (OpenAI + Next.js)

Overview:
This module adds AI-generated infographic creation to our Next.js app, enhanced with a “Layout Control” component that lets users select a visual structure (timeline, comparison, bar chart, flowchart) before invoking the OpenAI DALL·E 3 image generation API.

On top of the AI Generated graphic we want to strategically place div boxes with Text Areas where we can insert statistics and important wording.
